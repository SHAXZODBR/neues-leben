Pharmacies and hospital buyers expect more than price lists—they expect proactive
communications that match the critical nature of their work. Building that level
of service means aligning operations, data, and people around the same truth.

### Playbook pillars

1. **Predictive inventory signals** – every account manager receives automated
   alerts before a product approaches safety stock. They can trigger holds,
   substitutes, or expedited replenishment with a single click.
2. **Transparent order tracking** – we expose the same milestone data that our
   internal control tower sees, including handoffs, customs checkpoints, and
   real-time ETA adjustments.
3. **Always-on support** – multilingual support hubs, guided workflows, and
   embedded knowledge bases ensure someone can answer specialized questions
   without waiting for a single subject-matter expert.

### What’s next

We are layering sentiment analytics over inbound conversations so category leads
can see how launches land in each region. Expect future deep dives into the data
models and operational scripts that make this possible.
