Maintaining a validated cold chain is one of the most critical responsibilities
for inpatient and retail pharmacies. A single excursion can put entire batches
at risk and trigger expensive write‑offs.

### Core audit sections

1. **Equipment & mapping** – confirm that every refrigerator and freezer has
   been mapped, has a unique ID, and is linked to the correct department.
2. **Continuous monitoring** – verify that probes are calibrated, alarms are
   tested monthly, and backup data exports are stored securely.
3. **Operational workflows** – review how teams document excursions, quarantine
   stock, and communicate with manufacturers and regulators.
