When we first met the team at City Hospital, their pharmacy was fighting daily
fires: unplanned stock‑outs, emergency transfers from sister hospitals, and
stressful conversations with clinicians.

### The starting point

- No shared view of incoming deliveries.
- Manual spreadsheets for critical care items.
- Late discovery of manufacturer back‑orders.

Together we rolled out a phased playbook that introduced demand sensing,
exception dashboards, and collaborative forecasting sessions every month.

Within three months:

- Stock‑outs on the critical list dropped by **43%**.
- Emergency transfers were cut in half.
- The chief pharmacist reported that “for the first time, our calendar drives
  the conversation—not the crisis of the day.”

Future posts will break down the dashboards and workflows so other hospitals
can adapt the same approach.
