Every month we compile the most important regulatory changes that our partner
pharmacies and distributors need to know about. November brought several
updates that affect cold‑chain handling, serialized packaging, and import
licensing.

In this edition we summarize:

- New guidance on acceptable evidence for GDP compliance.
- Updated timelines for serialisation roll‑out on specific ATC classes.
- Clarifications on documentation for returns and product recalls.

Our regulatory team tracks these changes across multiple languages so your
front‑line staff can focus on patients instead of paperwork.
