Keeping freight on schedule requires the right blend of software and on-the-ground
partners. In this article we cover how Neues Leben:

1. Scores lanes based on risk signals and weather data.
2. Monitors partner performance with live telemetry.
3. Automates exception handling with our orchestration engine.

### Key metrics we watch

- Average dwell time per hub
- Carrier acceptance rate
- Customs processing velocity

These metrics inform where to invest in new warehouses, training, or automation.
Expect future posts that break each pillar down with dashboards, APIs, and playbooks
you can try inside your own network.
