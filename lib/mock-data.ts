<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Cardiac imaging has evolved dramatically over the past decade, with new technologies enabling earlier diagnosis and more precise treatment planning. This comprehensive review examines the latest advances in cardiac imaging modalities and their clinical applications in modern cardiology practice.</p>

<h2>3D Echocardiography: Revolutionizing Cardiac Assessment</h2>
<p>Three-dimensional echocardiography provides unprecedented visualization of cardiac structures, allowing clinicians to assess chamber volumes, valve anatomy, and function with remarkable precision. The technology has become essential in planning complex interventions and assessing valvular disease severity.</p>
<p>Recent studies demonstrate that 3D echo improves diagnostic accuracy for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left ventricular volume assessment and ejection fraction calculation</li>
<li>Atrial septal defect (ASD) anatomy and sizing</li>
<li>Mitral valve prolapse and degenerative disease</li>
<li>Right ventricular function assessment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h2>
<p>Cardiac MRI remains the gold standard for myocardial tissue characterization and is increasingly used for assessment of infiltrative and inflammatory cardiac conditions. Unlike echocardiography, MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast and can assess myocardial fibrosis with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging.</p>
<p>Clinical applications include detection of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Myocardial infarction and scar tissue</li>
<li>Cardiomyopathies (hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive)</li>
<li>Myocarditis and acute coronary syndrome</li>
<li>Cardiac masses and thrombi</li>
</ul>

<h2>Artificial Intelligence in Cardiac Imaging</h2>
<p>Machine learning algorithms are now being integrated into cardiac imaging analysis, improving efficiency and consistency in measurements and disease detection. AI applications include automated segmentation, quantification, and risk stratification.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The future of cardiac imaging lies in the integration of multiple modalities with advanced computational analysis, leading to personalized risk stratification and treatment planning. Healthcare institutions should consider adopting these technologies to improve patient outcomes and clinical efficiency.</p>
